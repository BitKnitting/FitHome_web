# FitHome Hardware and Software
The FitHome hardware and software projects are all open source.  It would be great if you want to help us improve!
## Thanks to Those That Went Before
This project extends [Tisham Dhar's work on building energy monitors using an atm90e26](https://github.com/whatnick/DIN_Rail_EnergyMonitor).  In particular, [the DIN Rail energy monitor](https://www.crowdsupply.com/whatnick/atm90e26-energy-monitor-kits).  Besides his open source projects, Tisham has been exceptionally helpful and supportive.  Tisham continues to inspire me.  THANK YOU.

Before I took [Chris Gammell's Contextual Electronics course](https://contextualelectronics.com/), I had absolutely no experience with electronics or building PCBs.  Chris is exceptional in so many ways.  THANK YOU.

There is an exceptional community behind [the OpenEnergyMonitor project](https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/).  They not only provide energy monitoring solutions, but are a wealth of knowledge.  THANK YOU.  In particular, thanks to the kindly delivered advice and help from Robert Wall.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
