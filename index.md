# FitHome is a Personal Trainer for lowering your electricity consumption.  
__Save $200/year - or more -__ on your electricity bill with no changes to your lifestyle.<br>    
__Save lives__.  [If all households in the US saved at least 15%](https://aceee.org/research-report/h1801):  
  * 6 lives would be saved per day.
  * There would be 30,000 fewer asthma episodes.  

__Save the planet__.  Using less electricity makes it easier for renewable energy sources to meet our electricity needs.
