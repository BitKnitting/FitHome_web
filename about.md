# Us
We want to use our skills in building and shipping software and hardware to make a positive difference in our community. The area that interested us the most was moving towards  100% clean and healthy energy.

We started to become mindful of the amount of electricity we were wasting (about 40%).  We figured if we wasted this much, many others must be wasting a lot of electricity.  But so what?  
## Our Contribution
We are not interested in making or losing money.  We want to make an impact.
  
Our contribution towards 100% clean and healthy energy focuses on conserving electricity.  We figure the cleanest and healthiest electricity is the electricity we don't use.  If we all conserve, it will be easier to get to 100% clean and healthy energy.
# Become a 15%er 
## Healthier Living
[The ACEE Report, _Saving Energy, Saving Lives_](https://aceee.org/research-report/h1801) pointed out...  
_Nationwide, __reducing electricity consumption by 15%__ for a single year would result in_:  
* More than six lives saved each day
* Up to $20 billion in avoided health harms
* Nearly 30,000 fewer asthma episodes
## Save Money
IF you use 15% less electricity, you would save $200 a year.
### Electricity cost breakdown
In our city (Kirkland, Washington), there are [38,093 housing units](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF).  While the weather varies quite a bit between Eastern and Western Washington, for this discussion we'll use [the EIA's info on the average monthly amount of electricity consumed](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf) as 955kWh.  

We live in Kirkland, Washington.  Our electricity cost is (at the time of this writing):  
* $.10 for the first 600 kWh  
* $.12 for each additional kWh
* Basic charge of $7.87 / month
* City tax of 6.04%  
* State tax of 3.873%

If a household uses 955 kWh/month, their electricity cost is roughly $121.82 /month.  
```
(.1*600)+(.12*355)+7.87 = $110.47  
110.47 + (.0604*110.47) + (.03783*110.47) = $121.32
```
If a household starts using 15% less electricity, their electricity cost is roughly 
```
855*.85 = 812 kWh/month
(.1*600) + (.12*212) + 7.87 = $93.31
93.31 + (.0604*93.31) + (.03783*93.31) = $102.48
```
a savings of $18.84 / month or $206 / year.  
# Together we can Help Combat Climate Change
The 38,093 households in my city are using 36,378,815 kWh/month (38,093 * 955). Or 436,545,780 kWh / year.  That is 340,288 Tons of greenhouse gas emissions (using the [Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator)).  This is equivalent to the amount of CO2 2.505 acres of forests can sequester.  
  
__If we all used 15% less electricity, we'd be using  65,481,867 kWh less per year.  Just 15% means we decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 51.043 Tons.__
