# Us
We want to use our skills in building and shipping software and hardware to make a positive difference. The area that interested us the most was moving towards  100% clean and healthy energy.  

The area we decided to focus on is lowering our mindless use of electricity.  We found from our own experience, we were using 40% more than we needed with no change to our lifestyles.  If this is true for us, we figure it is true for many others.

Given the cleanest and healthiest electricity is the electricity we don't use, it will be easier to get to 100% clean and healthy energy if we cut down on wasteful consumption of electricity.  Besides, we save money.  What's not to like?

The challenge we aspire to conquer with the FitHome Experience is to make it extremely easy for any homeowner to immediate lower the amount of electricity they use with no change to their lifestyle.

# Become a 15%er 
The FitHome experience is successful if the participants use 15% less electricity than they did before participating.  Consuming 15% less electricity is a reachable goal.  After all, [folks in Germany use 54% less electricity than folks in the US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_consumption){:target="_blank"}. Of course, there could be many reasons for this difference perhaps it is because:  
* less air conditioning and heating is used.  [The temperatures are not that different.  Perhaps us folks in the Seattle area use more air conditioning because there are 306 more hours of sunlight?](http://www.seattle.climatemps.com/vs/berlin.php){:target="_blank"} 
* houses are constructed to be more energy efficient. 
* houses are better insulated.  
* more Germans hang their clothes up to dry instead of using a dryer.  
* there is more regulation on energy efficiency.
* the average house size is smaller.  

But still given the 54% difference, we should be able to save 15%.  When we took the FitHome challenge, we ended up saving 40%.  With no change to our lifestyle.

## Healthier Living
[The ACEE Report, _Saving Energy, Saving Lives_](https://aceee.org/research-report/h1801){:target="_blank"} pointed out...  
_Nationwide, __reducing electricity consumption by 15%__ for a single year would result in_:  
* More than six lives saved each day
* Up to $20 billion in avoided health harms
* Nearly 30,000 fewer asthma episodes  

## Save Money

If you use 15% less electricity, you would save $200 a year.
### Electricity cost breakdown
In our city (Kirkland, Washington), there are [38,093 housing units](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml){:target="_blank"}.  While the weather varies quite a bit between Eastern and Western Washington, for this discussion we'll use [the EIA's info on the average monthly amount of electricity consumed](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/sales_revenue_price/pdf/table5_a.pdf){:target="_blank"} as 955kWh.  

Our electricity cost is (at the time of this writing):  
* $.10 for the first 600 kWh  
* $.12 for each additional kWh
* Basic charge of $7.87 / month
* City tax of 6.04%  
* State tax of 3.873%

If a household uses 955 kWh/month, their electricity cost is roughly $121.82 /month.  
```
(.1*600)+(.12*355)+7.87 = $110.47  
110.47 + (.0604*110.47) + (.03783*110.47) = $121.32
```
If a household starts using 15% less electricity, their electricity cost is roughly 
```
855*.85 = 812 kWh/month
(.1*600) + (.12*212) + 7.87 = $93.31
93.31 + (.0604*93.31) + (.03783*93.31) = $102.48
```
a savings of $18.84 / month or $206 / year.  
# Together we can Help Combat Climate Change
The 38,093 households in Kirkland use 36,378,815 kWh/month (38,093 * 955). Or 436,545,780 kWh / year of electricity.  That is 340,288 Tons of greenhouse gas emissions (using the [Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator](https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator){:target="_blank"}).  This is equivalent to the amount of CO2 2,505 acres of forests can sequester.  
  
__If we all used 15% less electricity, we'd be using  65,481,867 kWh less per year.  Just 15% means we decrease the amount of greenhouse gas emissions by 51,043 Tons.__
